### Proposed Models



### Notes
**Bias:** Difference between average prediction and correct output. Model with high bias pays little attention to training data and oversimplifies the model, resulting in high error on training and testing data.

**Variance:** Spread of predicted outputs for given data point. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and overfits the data, resulting in high error on testing data.

**Bias-variance tradeoff:** A model with few parameters may have high bias and low variance, while a model with many parameters may have high variance and low bias. An optimal model will find the balance between bias and variance and minimize the total error.
