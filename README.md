# Credit Risk Modeling with Low Default Portfolios


### State-of-the-Art Paper
A systematic search methodology was used to compile relevant papers on recent machine learning methods for imbalanced learning. The paper has been uploaded as a PDF file in this GitHub repository.


### Proposed Models
The four models that have shown good performance in research and will be evaluated on the German credit dataset are...
1. Example-Dependent Cost-Sensitive Decision Trees
2. Ordinal Multi-Class Support Vector Machine
3. Extreme Gradient Boosting
4. Cluster-Based Undersampling with Boosting


### Notes
**Bias:** Difference between average prediction and correct output. Model with high bias pays little attention to training data and oversimplifies the model, resulting in high error on training and testing data.

**Variance:** Spread of predicted outputs for given data point. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and overfits the data, resulting in high error on testing data.

**Bias-variance tradeoff:** A model with few parameters may have high bias and low variance, while a model with many parameters may have high variance and low bias. An optimal model will find the balance between bias and variance and minimize the total error.
